## Cool (and light-ish) animations

Working on a little homepage animation for weld. This is the skeleton. I like to part out my files so I don't polute the repo for the team with a mess I end up reverting anyway...

I'd say this one is sorta closed since I am about to migrate all of this to the actual codebase. I'll use this sandbox again if I need js animations.
