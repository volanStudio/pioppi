# pioppi

## My Human Powered Theme Park

I work in bits occasionally. They get out of sync and I need a little version control. I really liked the idea of this dude building [weird rides in the middle of nowhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCQEc736GO4), so that is where the name comes from; ai pioppi!
