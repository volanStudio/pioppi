# GIFc

## A (hard G) GIF creation workflow for going from video to GIF

GIFc requires the following packages:

`` homebrew install ffmpeg ``

`` homebrew install gifcicle ``

## Running GIFc

GIFc takes a video file as an input and creates a directory with your animated gif and the source files of the resultant GIF

Currently outputs an 8 fps GIF.

`` python GIFc.py {videoFile} {gifName} ``
